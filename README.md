=======
# Devuan's Simple Distro Kit - shared library

This is a set of ZSh based scripts shared across other Devuan's SDK components to accomplish common tasks.

All Devuan's SDK components are found here https://git.devuan.org/groups/sdk

## Requirements

Devuan's SDK is designed to be used interactively from a terminal as well
from shell scripts. It requires the following packages to be installed:

```
zsh debootstrap expect sudo
```

# Caveat

This is an early release with limited functionality to facilitate the
import and maintainance of some packages that are core to Devuan.

Some things may change in the immediate future.

To support the development you are welcome to open issues on problems
and bugs you encounter, open merge requests of patches or simply
getting involved in other tasks evident on https://git.devuan.org
